# Fix for "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'recentActivity')" Error

## Problem
The application was throwing a JavaScript error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'recentActivity')" in both Admin and Chief dashboard components.

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the code was trying to access `data.recentActivity.map(...)` without checking if `data.recentActivity` was null or undefined. When the backend API returned null for the recentActivity field, the map function failed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Admin.jsx
- Added null check before mapping over `data.recentActivity`
- Added fallback UI with "No recent activity" message when recentActivity is empty or null
- Changed from: `{data.recentActivity.map(...)}`
- Changed to: `{data.recentActivity && data.recentActivity.length > 0 ? data.recentActivity.map(...) : <p>No recent activity</p>}`

### 2. ChiefDashboard.jsx
- Added null check before mapping over `data.recentActivity`
- Added fallback UI with "No recent activity" message when recentActivity is empty or null
- Changed from: `{data.recentActivity.map(...)}`
- Changed to: `{data.recentActivity && data.recentActivity.length > 0 ? data.recentActivity.map(...) : <p>No recent activity</p>}`

## Files Modified
- `Main/Frontend/src/Components/Admin.jsx`
- `Main/Frontend/src/Components/ChiefDashboard.jsx`

## Testing
The changes should prevent the JavaScript error and provide a better user experience by showing a friendly message when there's no recent activity data.

## Status
âœ… Completed - Both files have been successfully updated with proper null checks and fallback UI.
